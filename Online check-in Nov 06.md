## 🚀 Progress & Plan

### ✅ Setup Completed
- Installed a heat-sink to cool down the SoC and connected peripheral hardware.  
- Push button soldered and connected to GPIO 17.  
- Enclosure currently being 3D printed.  
- Camera installed and tested.

### 🤖 Algorithm / Design Understanding and Implementation
- Model trained using 15 pictures (5 per person) of the project group.  
- The system detects faces and matches them to known encodings successfully.  

### 📈 Results Generation Plan
- The final output will be a **fully functional physical product** capable of real-world facial recognition.  
- The device recognizes a person’s face and labels it accordingly.  
- Notifications are sent to the user via the **PushBullet mobile application**.  

### 🎥 Demonstration Plan
- Demonstrate the system by showing:
  - The camera capturing live images.  
  - The facial recognition system detecting a familiar face.  
  - A notification being sent to a connected phone.  

### ✍️ Writing Plan
- Created the initial paper structure in **Overleaf**, consisting of:
  - Introduction  
  - Problem Statement  
  - Literature Review  
  - Methodology  
  - Evaluation  
  - Conclusion  
- Most of the implementation is completed — focus for the upcoming weeks:
  - Creating diagrams for clarity.  
  - Writing and refining the report text.
